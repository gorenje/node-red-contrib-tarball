    <p>Compress and extract tarballs in xz and gzip format.</p>
<p>
  Supports xz and gzip compression.

<p><b>Compression</b>

<p>
  For compression, <code>msg.payload</code> is assumed to be an array containing
  objects of the form:

<p>
  <code>
  {<br>
    path: "full path in tar file",<br>
    payload: "file content",<br>
  }<br>
  </code>
<p>
  Payload is assumed to be a <code>Buffer</code> object. If <code>path</code> is not defined, the
  entry is ignored.

<p>
  Returned is a tar archive which can then be compressed using 
  <a href="https://flows.nodered.org/node/@ecraneworldwide/node-red-contrib-lz4" target="_blank">Lzma</a>
  or <a href="https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-gzip" target="_blank">Gzip</a>.
  
<p><b>Extraction</b>

<p>
  Extraction assumes that the msg.payload is an ArrayBuffer with
  the contents of the tarball. Either encoded in xz format or
  gzip format.

<p>
  A message is generated as each file is extracted. All data is encoded
  in a <code>Buffer</code> object as it is not possible to distinguish between
  binary content and text content. The message has a <code>path</code> attribute 
  for the file name and <code>payload</code> contains the buffer with the files
  contents.

<p>
  Once all files have been extracted, one file message is sent that
  contains <code>complete</code> set to true and <code>payload</code> being an array containing
  all files that were extracted. Each file is represented by a hash
  object: 
<p>
  <code>
  {<br>
    path: "full path of file",<br>
    payload: &lt;Buffer object containing file contents&gt;<br>
  }<br>
  </code>
